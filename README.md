#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A methodical approach to designing, creating, and maintaining software is known as software engineering. It goes through several phases, including  design, coding, testing, requirements analysis, and maintenance. 
Software engineering is essential in the technology sector for producing high-quality solutions that satisfy customers and operate dependably. It makes it possible to design adaptable and scalable systems that can adjust to shifting needs, cutting expenses over time and boosting security. Adhering to appropriate software engineering principles can also assist save expensive errors and guarantee that projects are finished on schedule and under budget.




Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Important turning points in the history of software engineering include the development of structured programming in the 1960s, which increased the reliability of code; the introduction of object-oriented programming in the 1980s, which allowed for reuse and modularity; and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s, which promoted adaptability and teamwork in the development process.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The steps that comprise the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are as follows:
1. Planning: Specifies the goals, parameters, and viability of the project.
2. Requirements Analysis: Compiles and records comprehensive software specifications.
3. Design: Develops the architecture and design guidelines for the software.
4. Implementation (Coding): Using the design as a guide, developers write the code.
5. Testing: To find and address any problems, the software is tested.
6. Deployment: Users are granted access to the software within the production setting.
7. Maintenance: After deployment, the program is updated and enhanced throughout time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile vs. Waterfall Methodologies

The waterfall method is a sequential, linear process where each stage is dependent on the success of the previous one. It works effectively for projects where changes are improbable and a clear framework is required, like government contracts or systems that must comply with regulations. For instance, the rigorous structure and thorough documentation of Waterfall might be advantageous for developing a healthcare record system subject to stringent legal constraints.

Agile is a flexible, iterative methodology that divides development work into manageable chunks known as sprints. This allows for ongoing input and adjustment. Agile is best suited for projects with changing requirements, like those in startup settings, app development, or e-commerce platforms, where quick delivery is crucial and client needs could alter. Agile's flexibility would be ideal for creating a new mobile application that receives regular user input, for example.

Selecting the Correct Method: Agile is better suited for dynamic contexts where requirements may change and rapid, iterative development is required, whereas Waterfall is best for projects with defined, unchanging requirements.

Agile development is suitable for projects that are dynamic and require rapid iterative development due to changing requirements. However, when a systematic, sequential approach is required for a project with well-defined, stable requirements, waterfall methodology works well.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Within a software engineering team, a software developer creates and updates code to guarantee its effectiveness and operation. A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer plans, develops, and runs software quality assurance tests in addition to reporting bugs. In order to guarantee timely and cost-compliant delivery, a project manager supervises project planning, coordination, and risk management.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Code management and development productivity are greatly enhanced by integrated development environments, or IDEs. Code editors, debugging tools, and error checks are among the functions they provide. As an illustration, Visual Studio Code offers an adaptable environment along with code completion and extensions, but IntelliJ IDEA is renowned for its powerful Java development tools and sophisticated debugging features.

Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential for tracking project history, collaboration, and code modifications. They maintain track of all changes and enable several developers to collaborate peacefully on the same codebase. For collaborative development, Subversion (SVN) provides a centralised system appropriate for business settings, whereas Git is a well-liked distributed VCS used with platforms like GitHub.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Managing demand changes, handling technical debt, and maintaining software quality are just a few of the difficulties faced by software engineers. Utilising project management tools, automating testing, and implementing Agile methodologies are some ways to get around these. Enhancing overall efficiency and addressing these problems also requires efficient communication and ongoing learning.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is the process of confirming that each unit of code operates as intended by verifying its functionality. Integration testing looks at how several systems or modules interact with one another to find problems that could develop. System testing evaluates the program as a whole to make sure it satisfies all specifications and functions properly across the board. End users or other stakeholders participate in acceptance testing to make sure the program satisfies their needs and expectations prior to release. For the purpose of identifying various problems and guaranteeing that the program is dependable and up to par, each kind is essential.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering entails creating useful inputs to direct AI models, guaranteeing that they generate pertinent and accurate outputs. It increases efficiency by decreasing follow-up enquiries, accuracy by increasing output precision, and customisation of responses. By increasing the responsiveness and intuitiveness of interactions, this technique also enhances the user experience. Sufficient rapid engineering is necessary to maximise the usefulness and performance of AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about the project."

Improved prompt: "Summarise the key milestones and current status of the software development project for our e-commerce platform, including recent achievements or issues."

The updated prompt is more successful because it makes it obvious what information is required, concentrates on the pertinent project, and gives precise instructions on the type of material that is needed. This encourages more precise and pertinent responses.
